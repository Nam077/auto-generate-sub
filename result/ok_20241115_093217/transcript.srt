00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,740
Let's talk about Python. What is it, how does it work, and how you can get started today.

2
00:00:05,099 --> 00:00:08,019
All of that and more in two minutes. Start the timer.

3
00:00:12,259 --> 00:00:17,559
Python is a prevalent general purpose programming language often used for machine learning and data analysis.

4
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:23,179
Python was created by Guido van Rossum and was first released on February 20th, 1991.

5
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:27,839
This language is so influential that in 1999 the Zen of Python was released,

6
00:00:27,859 --> 00:00:32,100
which is a guiding set of principles for using Python in the utmost Mr. Miyagi way.

7
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:36,960
There are numerous reasons why this language is hotter than the Backstreet Boys were in 1997.

8
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:41,359
The first being that Python is very readable, like it states in the Zen of Python.

9
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:45,079
Simple is better than complex, and that's exactly what the language mirrors.

10
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:49,000
Python can also handle a multitude of different jobs, from machine learning,

11
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:52,200
to data analytics, web development, testing, and so on.

12
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:56,060
There is no need to debate how great this language is. But how can we use it?

13
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:59,560
You can download Python on the official Getting Started With Python page.

14
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:05,760
Once downloaded, creating a file with Python is as easy as naming the file and ending it with .py.

15
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:07,939
These files are also referred to as modules.

16
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:11,299
Then all you need to do is print hello world and there you go.

17
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,980
You can brag to all your friends that you are the next Bill Gates.

18
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:17,859
You have probably heard of interpreted versus compiled, right?

19
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:22,599
Well, Python is an interpreted language, which means the source code is converted into

20
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:25,939
byte code that is then executed by the Python virtual machine.

21
00:01:25,939 --> 00:01:30,439
This equates to Python being extremely fast to develop, but not so fast during the execution

22
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:33,920
step since the code is not directly compiled and executed.

23
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,500
But why should we learn Python?

24
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:40,099
Probably the most important answer to that is just how beginner-friendly the language is.

25
00:01:40,219 --> 00:01:44,519
If you're brand new to web development, my recommendation is either learn Python or JavaScript.

26
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,040
You can't go wrong with either.

27
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:49,439
As we mentioned before, Python is also extremely versatile.

28
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:52,140
You can do so many different tasks with just one language.

29
00:01:52,299 --> 00:01:55,140
Lastly, Python developers are extremely in demand.

30
00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:00,439
There are 36,000 job postings on Zippercrooter at this current moment for entry-level Python

31
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:00,939
developers.

32
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:04,620
