1
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:03,430
How does a microchip work?

2
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:10,689
This modern world, it's driven by something incredibly tiny.

3
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:14,730
The beating heart of your gadgets, the microchip.

4
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:19,609
At its core, microchips are made of silicon,

5
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,449
the second most abundant element on earth.

6
00:00:24,379 --> 00:00:27,600
Why? Silicon is a semiconductor.

7
00:00:28,339 --> 00:00:31,420
It can both conduct and resist electricity,

8
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:35,679
a unique property crucial for microchips.

9
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:38,719
Transistors are the magic beans.

10
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:43,509
Acting as electronic switches, they can be on or off.

11
00:00:44,409 --> 00:00:48,869
Millions, even billions, come together to make a single chip.

12
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:53,060
It's this binary language of ons and offs,

13
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,859
ones and zeros, that forms the basis of digital computing.

14
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:02,159
Microchip manufacturing is an art.

15
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:08,920
Multiple layers of materials are added, altered or etched away on the silicon wafer.

16
00:01:09,579 --> 00:01:12,260
Each layer serves specific functions,

17
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:17,019
from conducting electricity to insulating different components.

18
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:22,989
The chip's architecture, its design, is a blueprint of interconnections,

19
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:27,049
ensuring each transistor communicates correctly.

20
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:31,819
When powered, electricity flows through the chip.

21
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:35,939
Transistors work in groups, forming logic gates.

22
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:40,709
These gates process binary inputs to produce specific outputs,

23
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:43,189
the basics of computation.

24
00:01:44,219 --> 00:01:46,659
Every chip has a clock, giving it rhythm.

25
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:50,340
With each tick, commands are processed.

26
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:53,400
Faster clocks mean more ticks per second,

27
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:55,819
translating to quicker processing.

28
00:01:55,819 --> 00:02:01,099
Hence, clock speed is often a measure of a chip's capability.

29
00:02:02,329 --> 00:02:04,069
Not all transistors process.

30
00:02:04,569 --> 00:02:09,490
Some remember, certain configurations store data, albeit temporarily.

31
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:14,569
This volatile memory, or RAM, holds data for quick access.

32
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:18,530
Others store data long-term, like in flash memory.

33
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:23,490
Modern microchips, like SoCs, aren't just CPUs.

34
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:28,490
They combine processors, graphics units, memory and more,

35
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:31,469
offering a complete system in one chip.

36
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:34,379
The magic is in miniaturization.

37
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,280
As tech evolved, transistors shrunk.

38
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:43,199
Today's microchips pack billions in a space smaller than your fingernail.

39
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:44,680
But challenges arise.

40
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:48,960
They generate heat, hence cooling solutions in devices.

41
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:52,199
Silicon's reign may not last forever.

42
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:57,659
Engineers eye materials like graphene and gallium nitride,

43
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:01,219
aiming to craft even more efficient chips.

44
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:06,780
Tiny they may be, microchips power our colossal digital world.

45
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,800
Every click, swipe or beep at its heart

46
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,860
is the dance of transistors on a speck of silicon.
